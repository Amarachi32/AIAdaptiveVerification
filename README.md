Set up your Azure AI Foundry project:

csharp
// In appsettings.json
{
  "AzureAI": {
    "Endpoint": "your-project-endpoint",
    "Credential": "DefaultAzureCredential"
  }
}
```:cite[2]
Configure OpenAI settings:

csharp

var endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PROJECT_ENDPOINT");
AIProjectClient projectClient = new AIProjectClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());
```:cite[2]
Build and Run
bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
🔧 Usage
Basic Implementation
csharp
// Initialize the verification service
var verificationService = new AdaptiveVerificationService();

// Process user verification
var result = await verificationService.ValidateUserAsync(userInformation, verificationPrompt);

// Handle verification result
if (result.IsValid)
{
    // Proceed with verified user
}
Integration with Azure AI Foundry
csharp
// Set up AI project client
var endpoint = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PROJECT_ENDPOINT");
AIProjectClient projectClient = new(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential());

// Access AI models and services
var agentsClient = projectClient.GetPersistentAgentsClient();
```:cite[2]
